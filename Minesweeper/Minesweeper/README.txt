Compatability:
~~~~~~~~~~~
This game has been tested and was found to work properly in the latest version of
Google Chrome and Internet Explorer. This game does not work right in Firefox.

Support & Troubleshooting:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you encounter any problems with the game, and if you are playing in an up-to-date
version of Chrome or Internet Explorer, please let Aswin Ganesh know.

How to play:
~~~~~~~~~
This minesweeper can contain 9,10 or 11 mines in a 8X8 grid. Once you click on a block,
a number shows the number of mines in the surrounding blocks (Including diagonal ones).
If the number is 0, all surronding blocks are revealed.
The game is won if you uncover all blocks except the ones with mines.
Clicking on a box with a mine will end the game.

Coming Soon:
~~~~~~~~~~~
A customizable grid and number of mines.
Customizable number of mines can be implemented now, but will be useless without a 
customizable grid. If any programmers can provide an algorithm to make customizable 
grid possible, the help will be appreciated!

Conclusion
~~~~~~~~~
Thanks again for playing this game, and have a nice day!
